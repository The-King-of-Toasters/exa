.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a modern replacement for
.Xr ls 1 .
It colors information by default to distinguish between filetypes,
such as whether you are the owner or in the owning group. It also has
features not present in the original
.Xr ls ,
such as viewing the
.Xr git-status 1
for a directory or recursing into directories with a tree view.
.Sh DISPLAY OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 1 , Fl Fl oneline

.It Fl G , Fl Fl grid

.Pq default .
.It Fl l , Fl Fl long
display extended file metadata as a table.
.It Fl x , Fl Fl across
sort the grid across, rather than downwards.
.It Fl R , Fl Fl recurse
recurse into directories.
.It Fl T , Fl Fl tree
recurse into directories as a tree.
.It Fl F , Fl Fl classify
display type indicator by file names.
.It Fl Fl color Ns = Ns Ar WHEN , Fl Fl colour Ns = Ns Ar WHEN
colorize output;
.Ar WHEN
can be
.Sq Ar always ,
.Sq Ar automatic
.Pq default
or
.Sq Ar never .
.It Fl Fl color-scale , Fl Fl colour-scale
highlight levels of file sizes distinctly.

.Sh FILTERING AND SORTING OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a , Fl Fl all
include entries that are hidden or begin with a dot
.Pq Sq \&. .
Use this twice to also include the
.Sq \&.
and 
.Sq ..
directories.
.It Fl d , Fl Fl listdirs
list directories like regular files.
.It Fl L , Fl Fl level Ns = Ns Ar DEPTH
limit the depth of recursion.
.It Fl r , Fl Fl reverse
reverse the sort order.
.It Fl s , Fl Fl sort Ns = Ns Ar SORT_FIELD
which field to sort entries by.
.Ar SORT_FIELD
can be:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Ar name , Name
\(em sort entries in alphabetical order.
.It
.Ar extension , Extension
\(em sort entries by their file extension in alphabetical order. Entries
without file extensions precede those that do.
.It
.Ar size
\(em sort entries by their file size.
.It
.Ar modified
\(em sort entries by modification date ascending.
.It
.Ar accessed
\(em sort entries by access date ascending.
.It
.Ar created
.It
.Ar inode
\(em sort entries by inode modification.
.It
.Ar type
.It
.Ar none
.El
The
.Ar modified
field has the aliases
.Ar date , time
and 
.Ar newest ,
and its reverse order has the aliases
.Ar age
and
.Ar oldest .
Fields starting with a capital letter will sort uppercase before lowercase:
.Sq A
then 
.Sq B
then
.Sq a
then
.Sq b .
Fields starting with a lowercase letter will mix them:
.Sq A
then
.Sq a
then
.Sq B
then
.Sq b .
.It Fl I , Fl Fl ignore-glob Ns = Ns Ar GLOB Ns Op | Ns Ar GLOB ...
pipe
.Pq Sq |
seperated
.Xr glob 7

.It Fl Fl git-ignore
ignore files mentioned in
.Xr gitignore 5 .
.It Fl Fl group-directories-first
list directories before other files.
.It Fl D , Fl Fl only-dirs
list only directories.
.El
.Sh LONG VIEW OPTIONS
These options are available when running with
.Fl l , Fl Fl long :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b , Fl Fl binary

.It Fl m , Fl Fl modified
use the modified timestamp field.
.It Fl S , Fl Fl blocks
list each file's number of file system blocks.
.It Fl t , Fl Fl time Ns = Ns Ar WORD
which timestamp field to list;
.Ar WORD
can be
.Sq Ar modified ,
.Sq Ar accessed
or
.Sq Ar created .
.It Fl Fl time-style Ns = Ns Ar STYLE
how to format timestamps;
.Ar STYLE
can be
.Ar default
.Pq Sq %d %b %H:%M ,
.Ar iso
.Po
.So %m-%d %H:%M Sc for entries modified within the current year,
.So %Y-%m-%d Sc for older entries
.Pc ,
.Ar long-iso
.Pq Sq %Y-%m-%d %H:%M
or
.Ar full-iso
.Pq Sq %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N %z .
.It Fl u , Fl Fl accessed
use the accessed timestamp field.
.It Fl U , Fl Fl created
use the created timestamp field.
.It Fl \&@, extended
list each file's extended attributes and sizes
.It Fl Fl git
list each file's
.Xr git-status 1 ,
if tracked.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
recognizes the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev COLUMNS
Overrides the width of the terminal, in characters. For example:
.Dl Ev COLUMNS Ns = Ns Ar 80
will show a grid view with a maximum width of 80 characters. This option
won't do anything when
.Nm exa Ns 's
output doesnt wrap, such as when using the
.Fl Fl Fl long
or
.Fl l
option.
.It Ev EXA_SRICT
Enables
.Em strict mode ,
which will make
.Nm
error when two options are incompatible. Options can override each other
going right-to-left so that
.Nm
can be aliased:
.Pp
setting
.Dl Nm alias Nm Ns = Ns Ql Nm Fl Fl sort Ns = Ns Ar ext Ns
then running
.Dl $ Nm Fl Fl sort Ns = Ns Ar size
will run
.Dl Nm Fl Fl sort Ns = Ns Ar ext Fl Fl sort Ns = Ns Ar size ,
with the sort field specified by the user overriding the sort field specified
by the alias. In
.Em strict mode ,
the two options will not cooperate, and exa will error.
.Pp
This option is intended for use with automated scripts and situations where
you want to use the right command.
.It Ev EXA_GRID_ROWS
Limits the grid-details view set by
.Fl Fl grid
and
.Fl Fl long ,
so that it is only activated when at least the given number of rows of
output would be generated. With widescreen displays, it is possible for
the grid to look very wide and sparse, on just one or two lines with none
of the columns lining up. By specifying a minimum number of rows, you can
only use the view if it's going to be worth using.
.It Ev LS_COLORS , EXA_COLORS
Colorize entries according to specific patterns. See
.Xr exa-colors 5
for more info.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
List the contents of the current working directory, with entries sorted by
largest size decending:
.Pp
.Dl $ Nm Fl Fl reverse Fl Fl sort Ns = Ns Ar size
.Pp
Display a tree of entries, three levels deep:
.Pp
.Dl $ Nm Fl Fl long Fl Fl tree Fl Fl level Ns = Ns Ar 3
