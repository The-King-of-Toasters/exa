.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a modern replacement for
.Xr ls 1 .
It colors information by default to distinguish between filetypes,
such as whether you are the owner or in the owning group.
It also has features not present in the original ls,
such as viewing the
.Xr git-status 1
for a directory or recursing into directories with a tree view.

Recursively list subdirectories as a tree.
.It Fl x , Fl -across

.Ss Filtering and Sorting Options
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.Pq Sq |
separated
.Xr glob 7
patterns of files to ignore.

.It Fl s Ar sort_field , Fl -sort Ns = Ns Ar sort_field
Which field to sort entries by.
.Ar sort_field
can be:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar name , Name , \&.name , \&.Name
Sort by alphabetical order.
.Pp
.Ar name
and
.Ar Name
are strictly alphabetical,
i.e, entries that begin with a dot will always precede those that don't.
The fields
.Ar \&.name
and
.Ar \&.Name
are equivalent to
.Ar name
and
.Ar Name ,
except that they ignore this starting dot when sorting alphabetically.
.Pp
.Ar name
is the default sort field for
.Nm .
.It Ar extension , ext , Extension , Ext
Sort by file extension in alphabetical order.
Entries without file extensions precede those that do.
.Ar ext
and
.Ar Ext
are equivalent to
.Ar extension
and
.Ar Extension .
.It Ar size , filesize
Sort by file size ascending.
.It Ar date , time , mod , modified , new , newest
Sort by modification date ascending.
.It Ar age , old , oldest
Sort by modification date decending.
.It Ar ac , accessed
Sort by access date ascending.
.It Ar cr , created
Sort by creation date ascending.
.It Ar inode
Sort by inode number ascending.
.It Ar type
Sort by filetype.
The order is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
Directories.
.It
Files.
.It
Links.
.It
Pipes.
.It
Sockets.
.It
Character devices.
.It

.Po Sq A
then
.Sq B
then
.Sq a
then
.Sq b
.Pc
whilst those starting with a lowercase letter will mix them
.Po
.Sq A
then

then
.Sq B
then
.Sq b
.Pc .
.It Fl -git-ignore

.Xr gitignore 5 .
.It Fl -group-directories-first
List directories before other files.
.El

.It Fl t Ar field , Fl -time Ns = Ns Ar field
Which timestamp field to list;
.Ar field
can be
.Sq Ar modified ,

.It Fl u , Fl -accessed
Use the accessed timestamp field.

Use the created timestamp field.
.It Fl -git
List each file's
.Xr git-status 1 ,

.It Fl -time-style Ns = Ns Ar style
How to format timestamps;
.Ar style
can be:

.Dq dd mmm hh:mm
.It Ar iso
.Dq mm-dd HH:MM

.Dq ccyy-mm-dd
for older entries

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
recognizes the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev COLUMNS
Sets the maximum character width for
.Nm Ap s
output,
e.g, a value of 80 will show a grid view with a maximum width of
80 characters.
This option won't do anything when
.Nm exa Ns 's
output doesn't wrap, such as when using the
.Fl l
option.
.It Ev EXA_STRICT
Enables
.Em strict mode ,
which will make
.Nm
error when two options are incompatible.
By default, options can override each other going right-to-left so that
.Nm
can be aliased.
For example, setting:
.Pp
.Dl alias exa='exa -s ext'
.Pp
then running:
.Pp
.Dl $ exa -s size
.Pp
will run
.Pp
.Dl exa -s ext -s size
.Pp
with the sort field specified by the user overriding the sort field
specified by the alias.
.Pp
In
.Em strict mode ,
the two options will not cooperate, and exa will error.
This option is intended for use with automated scripts and situations
where you want to use the right command.
.It Ev EXA_GRID_ROWS
Limits the grid-details view set by
.Fl G
and
.Fl l ,
so that it is only activated when at least the given number of rows of
output would be generated.
With widescreen displays, it is possible for the grid to look very wide
and sparse, on just one or two lines with none of the columns lining up.
By specifying a minimum number of rows,
you can only use the view if it's going to be worth using.
.It Ev LS_COLORS , EXA_COLORS
Colorize entries according to specific patterns.
See
.Xr exa-colors 5
for more info.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Li 0
No fatal errors occurred.
.It Li 1
At least one internal error occurred.
.It Li 2
At least one given file does not exist.
.It Li 3
.Nm
was invoked with an unknown argument,
or an argument was overridden with
.Em strict mode
enabled.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
List the contents of the current working directory, with entries sorted
by largest size decending:
.Pp
.Dl $ exa -rs size
.Pp
Display a tree of entries, three levels deep:
.Pp
.Dl $ exa -lT -L 3
